I’m currently navigating the final year of my Master of Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, after completing a Bachelor of Computer Science with distinction at Wuhan University in China. My journey in software engineering is paved with a blend of academic excellence, practical experience, and a continuous quest for learning. Courses like Foundations of Computer Systems and Data Science for Software Engineering aren't just items on my transcript; they're chapters of an ongoing adventure in tech.

My role as a **Research and Teaching Assistant** at Carnegie Mellon University has allowed me to dive deep into the world of Database Management Systems, where I've had the chance to re-engineer a SQLite-based DBMS enhancing its scalability and maintainability, and craft academic assignments that have enriched over 100 students’ understanding of complex database concepts. I developed a DBMS named CapybaraDB, a friendly but fully functional DB!

Previously, as a **Software Engineer** at I Got Games Inc., I immersed myself in the development of “Doomsday: Last Survivors”, an RPG and FPS game, pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning to create more immersive gaming experiences.

In the realm of technology, I am fluent in languages such as Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and Python, and I wield frameworks like React.js and NodeJS with ease. My toolbox also includes advanced skills in AWS, Docker, and Git, empowering me to build, deploy, and manage complex software applications with precision.

My work has led me to contribute to the field of academic research, co-authoring a publication on “Decision Analysis and Prediction Based on Credit Card Fraud Data”, presented at the 2nd European Symposium on Computer and Communications (ESCC ’21).

I’m on the lookout for opportunities that challenge me, allow me to leverage my diverse skill set, and contribute to meaningful projects that push the envelope of what technology can achieve. If you're in search of a dynamic, innovative software engineer who thrives in collaborative environments and is dedicated to driving technological advancements, let’s connect!
